//  Overview:  Backward-compatibility regression tests for BandwidthSample's Codable decoding.
//             Every .ssrec frame embeds a BandwidthSample; SessionReader skips any frame that
//             fails to decode, so if a NEWLY added BandwidthSample field is not tolerated when
//             absent, every pre-existing recording loses all its frames and opens as `.noFrames`.
//             These tests pin RecordingFormat.swift's policy ("additive fields stay backward-
//             compatible") at the exact struct where it is easiest to break: a non-optional field
//             added later (`isEstimated`) must decode to its default on files that predate it.
//  Notes:     Pure value-type Codable tests — no hardware, no file IO. The literal JSON shapes are
//             the on-disk frame shapes: pre-measuredTotalGBs, measuredTotalGBs-era, and current.
