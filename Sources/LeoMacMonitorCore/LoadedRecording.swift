//  Overview:  An in-memory, parsed .ssrec ready for replay: the meta, the frames, and a per-frame
//             table of the PATH-DEPENDENT derived scalars (the four decaying peaks + memory rates)
//             that can't be recovered from a trailing window. Precomputed once at load via the
//             shared MetricsEngine, so seeking to any frame is O(1) for scalars and O(60) to rebuild
//             the sparkline history window — smooth even on multi-hour recordings.
//  Notes:     The 60-sample sparkline History is NOT stored per frame (would be huge); it is rebuilt
//             on demand from the trailing frames via historyWindow(upTo:). index(forTime:) binary-
//             searches the frame timestamps. Pure value type.
