//  Developer: Leo Yuan
//  Overview:  Persistence for the menu-bar item list (#27, phase 4a) and the one-way migration off
//             the eight legacy per-metric `menubar.*` Bools. Lives in Core, next to the model, so
//             the migration is unit-testable — the app target has no test target, and the migration
//             is the part that can silently destroy a user's menu bar.
//  Notes:     ⚠️ NOT thread-safe and deliberately NOT `@MainActor` — Core must stay free of UI
//             isolation (CLAUDE.md §8.3). The app owns a single instance from the main actor.
//             ⚠️ `items` is CACHED. `sync()` runs at 1 Hz even with the dashboard closed, so the
//             JSON must never be decoded on that path (docs/energy-optimization.md FIX 3/4). The
//             cache is invalidated only by this type's own mutations.
//             Migration guards on `menubar.schemaVersion`, NOT on the presence of `menubar.items`:
//             presence alone would let a downgrade → toggle → re-upgrade silently discard the
//             interim change. After migrating, the legacy keys are frozen — read once here, never
//             written again — so downgrading restores the layout as it was at upgrade time.
