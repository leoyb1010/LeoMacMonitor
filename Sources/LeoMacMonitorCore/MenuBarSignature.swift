//  Overview:  Cheap value signatures for the menu-bar glyphs, used to skip re-rasterizing a
//             status-item bitmap that would come out pixel-identical. MetricBarController.sync
//             re-drew every glyph every tick (an always-on cost even with the dashboard closed);
//             now it only re-draws when the signature changes. See docs/energy-optimization.md FIX 3.
//  Notes:     Pure Foundation (no UI) so it lives in Core and is unit-tested. `quantize` maps a
//             0...1 bar fraction to the glyph's pixel-row resolution (bars are 18 pt ≈ 36 px tall
//             on a 2x display), so sub-pixel float jitter does NOT churn the signature, but any
//             visible (≥ one pixel row) change does. Text glyphs sign their already-formatted
//             strings (the string IS the visible quantization).

    /// menu-bar glyph stale for the life of the process.

    /// Note that `barRows` does NOT need to scale: macOS fixes the menu-bar height, so `Glyph.height`

    /// (the stacked label and value text grow), which is exactly what this tag catches.
