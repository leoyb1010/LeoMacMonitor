//  Overview:  Value type holding one unified-memory bandwidth reading (GB/s), split
//             by requestor. The headline signal for local-LLM throughput (token
//             generation is memory-bandwidth bound on Apple Silicon).
//  Notes:     cpuGBs = ECPU + PCPU* DCS traffic, gpuGBs = GFX, otherGBs = display /
//             media / IO / storage. Sum of read + write. `isEstimated` flags readings
//             from BandwidthSampler's PMP-histogram fallback path (see its file header).
//             Decoding is hand-written (`init(from:)`) rather than synthesized so that
//             ADDITIVE fields stay backward-compatible per RecordingFormat.swift's policy:
//             the synthesized decoder requires every non-optional key, so a field added
//             later (e.g. `isEstimated`) would throw .keyNotFound on older .ssrec frames and
//             SessionReader would drop every frame → an old recording opens as `.noFrames`.
//             decodeIfPresent + the property default keeps pre-existing recordings loading.
