//  Overview:  Latched "is this engine doing work" flags for the AI Workload card's CPU / GPU / ANE
//             / Media rows. A bare threshold on a live sample flaps: a GPU hovering around the
//             busy line alternates active/idle every tick, which reads as instability in the
//             MACHINE when it is really instability in the QUESTION.
//  Notes:     Two mechanisms, both needed:
//             - **hysteresis** — the level that turns a row ON is higher than the one that lets it
//               go OFF, so a value sitting exactly on one boundary cannot oscillate;
//             - **dwell** — a change must persist for N ticks before it is shown, so a single
//               spike or dropout does not flip the label.
//             ⚠️ Only the STATE is latched. The numbers beside it stay live — the row shows its
//             evidence every tick, and only the verdict is held steady.
//             `onDwell` < `offDwell` on purpose: an engine lighting up is the event worth seeing
//             promptly; an engine going quiet is worth confirming.
