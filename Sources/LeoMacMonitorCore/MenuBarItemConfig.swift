//  Developer: Leo Yuan
//  Overview:  The menu-bar item model for #27: a user-ordered LIST of item instances, replacing
//             the static 8-entry Spec array in MetricBarController where each metric was welded
//             to exactly one render mode and one data selection.
//             Lives in Core (no UI) so the model, its validation and the migration off the legacy
//             per-metric Bools are unit-testable — the app target has no test target.
//  Notes:     A metric can appear MORE THAN ONCE with different modes; identity is the instance
//             UUID, not the metric. `channels` is an array because arity depends on the mode
//             (twoLine needs exactly 2, value needs 1, bars takes N) and because GPU composes
//             three heterogeneous sources with different normalisers.
//             Every DataChannel carries its own reserveTemplate: without a worst-case width the
//             glyph's width changes as values grow and shoves every item to its left.
