//  File:      Theme.swift
//  Created:   2026-06-08
//  Updated:   2026-07-27
//  Developer: Leo Yuan
//  Overview:  Shared visual language and reusable UI atoms (Card, Bar, KV, Sparkline,
//             PopoverButtonStyle), plus the Layout dimension tokens.
//             Restrained instrument-panel look: one accent, muted heat colors, dense
//             monospaced typography. All in-app text is English.
//  Notes:     Theme.heat(fraction) maps 0...1 load to green/amber/red. Cards are
//             neutral (no per-card colors) so data — not chrome — carries the eye.
//             Bottleneck.color lives here (UI layer) so LeoMacMonitorCore stays SwiftUI-free.
//             Layout holds every fixed dimension, named by role; see docs/design-system.md.
//             Layout.Row's fixed-vs-minHeight comments are load-bearing (#23/#25/#16), and
//             Layout.hairline must never be scaled.
