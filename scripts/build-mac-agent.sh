#  Created:   2026-07-22
#  Updated:   2026-07-22
#  Developer: Leo Yuan
#  Overview:  Builds the headless Mac fleet agent (leomac-agent-mac) as a universal (arm64 + x86_64)
#             release binary — the download target for install-agent-mac.sh and the asset to attach
#             to a GitHub release. Uses xcrun so it links against the Xcode SDK (the swiftly default
#             toolchain can't find the macOS SDK).
#  Notes:     Output: dist/agent/leomac-agent-mac. For distribution, Developer ID–sign + notarize it
#             separately (same identity as the app). Requires the IOReport dynamic_lookup flag, which
#             the target already carries in Package.swift.
